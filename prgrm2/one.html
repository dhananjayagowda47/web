    <h1>Value of time</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color: red;font-size: larger;">&nbsp&nbspTim Lake grows up in Cornwall, in a house by the sea with his father James,
         mother Mary, absent-minded uncle Desmond, and free-spirited sister Katherine ("Kit Kat"). 
         On his 21st birthday, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the secret 
         ability to travel back in time, to moments they have lived before. James discourages his son 
         from using his gift to acquire money or fame,
         and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life.</p>
         <br>
         <p>The following summer, Kit Kat's friend Charlotte visits. Tim is instantly smitten, 
            but waits until the end of her stay to tell her how he feels; she tells him that he should have 
            told her earlier. Tim travels back in time to tell Charlotte in the middle of the holiday, but 
            she advises him to wait until her last day. Heartbroken,
             Tim realises she is uninterested in him, and that time travel cannot change anyone's mind.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a lawyer, living with his father's acquaintance, Harry, 
            an angry misanthropic playwright. Tim visits a Dans le Noir restaurant, where he meets Mary. 
            They flirt in the darkness, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to 
            find a distraught Harry, whose opening night of his new play has been ruined by an actor 
            forgetting his lines.
            Tim goes back in time to put things right, and the play is a triumph.</p>
